Need of Batch Updates:-> 
-> When we submit multiple SQL Queries to the database one by one then lot of time will be
wasted in request and response.

In the case of Simple Statement:-> 
java application <-> Request Time,Response Time <-> compile time,execution time
Total time per Query = Request time + compile time + execution time + response time 
1ms + 1ms + 1 ms + 1 ms = 4 ms
per 1000 queries = 4 * 10000ms = 4000ms 

In the case of preparedStatement :-> 
java application <-> Request time,Response time <-> database <-> execution time
Total time per query = Request time + response Time + execution time
1 ms + 1 ms + 1ms = 3 ms
1000 queries = 3000 ms

In the above 2 cases we are trying to submit 1000 queries to the database one by one. for
submitting 1000 queries we need to communicate with the database 1000 times. it increases
network traffic between java application and database and even creates performance problems
also.
-> to overcome these problems, we should go for Batch updates. we can group all related SQL
queries into a single batch and we can send that batch at a time to database
Java application <-> Batch of queries <-> database

With Simple Statement Batch Updates:->
Per 1000 queries = Req time + 1000 * compile time + 1000 * execution time + response time
1ms + 1000 * 1ms + 1000 * 1ms + 1ms
= 2002 ms

With PreparedStatement BatchUpdates:->
Per 1000 queries = req time + 1000 * execution time + response time
1ms + 1000 * 1ms + 1ms 
= 1002 ms

-> Hence the main advantage of batch updaets are 
-> we can reduce network traffic 
-> we can improve performance

we can implement batch updates by using the following two methods:

1. public void addBatch(String sqlQuery)
to add query to batch

2. int[] executeBatch()
to execute a batch of sql queries

Note:-> Batch updates applicable only for non select queries.

Advantages:->
-> Performance will be improved
-> Network traffic will be low

Dis-advantage:->
-> it is applicable only for non select query
-> within the batch if any one query execution failed then all other query execution will also failed.
