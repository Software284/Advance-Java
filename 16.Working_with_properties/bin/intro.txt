Properties:->
-> In Java Program if anything which changes frequently(like jdbc url,username,pwd etc) is 
not recommended to hard code in our program.
-> The problem in this approach is if there is any change in java program,to reflect that 
change we have to recompile,rebuild and redeploy total application and even some times server
restart also required,which creates a big business impact to the client.
-> To overcome this problem, we should go for properties file. the variable things we have to
configure in properties file and we have to read these properties from java program
-> The main advantage of this approach is if there is any change in properties file and to 
reflect that change just redployment is enough, which won't create any business impact to the
client.

How Many getConnection Method are available:->
i. Connection con = DM.getConnection(url,user,pass);
ii. Connection con = DM.getConnection(url,Properties p)
iii. Connection con = DM.getConnection(urls);

urls = jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl?user=sys as sysdba&pass=software
urls = jdbc:oracle:thin:sys as sysdba/software@localhost:1521:orcl
