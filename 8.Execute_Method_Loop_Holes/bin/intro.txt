Execute select and non select queries with execute method:->
Statement st = con.createStatement();
boolean b = st.execute(sqlQuery);
if(b==true){
ResultSet rs = st.getResultSet();
while(rs.next()){
}
}
else {
int updateCount = st.getUpdateCount();
sysout("the no of row effected="+updateCount);
}

executeQuery with non-select :-> result will vary from the driver to driver. in case of type-1 driver 
sql exception will be thrown.but in the case of type-4 driver we will get empty resultset. we never going
to get any exception.changes in db takes place.if we are trying to get empty resultset immediately we will get
exception.

executeUpdate with select :-> result will vary from the driver to driver. in case of type-1 driver sql exception
will be thrown. bu in the case of type-4 driver nothing will happen but we will get no of row effected count.

executeUpdate vs DDL :-> No error valid statement
type-1 : -1
type-4 : 0
