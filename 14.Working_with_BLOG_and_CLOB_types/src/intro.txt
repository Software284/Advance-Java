Working with Large Objects(BLOB and CLOB):-> Sometimes as the part of programming requirement,
we have to insert and retrieve large files like images,video files,audio files,resume etc
wrt database.
Eg:
-> upload image in matrinomial web sites
-> upload resume in job related web sites

-> to store and retrieve large information we should go for Large Objects(LOBs).
-> there are 2 types of large objects.
i. Binary Large Object(BLOB)
ii. Character Large Object(CLOB)

Binary Large Object(BLOB):->
-> A BLOB is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in the database.
-> BLOB type objects can be images,video files,audio files etc...
-> BLOB datatype can store maximum of "4GB" binary data.

CLOB(Character Large Objects):-> 
-> A CLOB is a collection of Character data stored as a single entity in the database.
-> CLOB can be used to store large text documents(may plain text or xml documents)
-> CLOB Type can store maximum of 4GB data.
Eg:hydhistory.txt

Create Table In Oracle With Blob:->
create table person(
 name varchar2(10),
 profile_pic blob
 );
 

Need of Buffer Concept in I/O Operations:->
-> Source File(10 KB) -> Destination File(10 KB)
-> Without buffering 10 * 1024 read & write Operations are required
-> Source File(10 KB) -> Buffer byte[](1 KB) -> destination file(10 kB)
-> Because of Buffer we have to perform only 10 read operations and 10 write operations


 create table animal(
  name varchar2(10),
  description clob
  );
